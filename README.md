# pivnet-bash-examples

These are some example scripts from the Ops Manager team showing how we use bash to interface with Pivotal Network.

These are very crude, because our release process is a moving target.  However, I hope they may be helpful to people looking to see a working example of uploading to Pivotal Network using bash.
